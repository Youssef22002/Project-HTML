      <p>The Temple of Artemis or Artemision 
            (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον; Turkish: Artemis Tapınağı), also known as the Temple of Diana,
             was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis (identified with Diana, a Roman goddess). 
             It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day Turkey). By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.[1] 
             Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.

<h2>Location and history</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    The Temple of Artemis (Artemision) was located near the ancient city of Ephesus,
     about 75 kilometres (47 mi) south from the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey.
     Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of Selçuk.</p>
     <br>

<p>The sacred site (temenos) at Ephesus was far older than the Artemision itself. 
    Pausanias was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years,
     being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at Didyma.[3] He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians.
      Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis attributed the earliest temenos at Ephesus to the Amazons,
       legendary warrior-women whose religious practise he imagined already centered upon an image (bretas) of Artemis,
        their matron goddess. Pausanias believed that the temple pre-dated the Amazons.[4]</p>

<h2>Destruction</h2>
<hr><P>
In 356 BC, the temple burned down. 
Various sources describe this as a vainglorious act of arson by a man,
 Herostratus, who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, 
 seeking fame at any cost; thus the term herostratic fame.[16] For this outrage, 
 the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and forbade anyone from mentioning his name;
  but Theopompus later noted it.[17] Aristotle's Meteorology describes the temple's conflagration,
   but not its cause.[18] In Greek and Roman historical tradition,
    the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of Alexander the Great (around 20/21 July 356 BC).
     Plutarch remarks that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple;
      he does not specify a cause for the fire.[19] </P>

        <p>Herostratus' part in the temple's destruction has been questioned in modern scholarship.
             Stefan Karweise notes that any arsonist would have needed access to the wooden roof framing;
             [20]: 57  Dieter Knibbe writes of an "entire corps" of attested temple guards and custodians.[21]: 88–89  
             The fire might even have been deliberately and covertly set by the temple's administrators,
             aware of that the temple's foundation was sinking, but prevented from re-siting it elsewhere by religious constraints;[21]
             : 89  Bammer has noted the conservation of the original sacred location throughout successive rebuildings, 
             despite continued problems with flooding and foundations
            .[22] Karwiese questions the motive of Herostratus since he only divulged his purpose under torture,
             which does not fit a man seeking fame.[20]: 57  Dieter Knibbe
             [de] considers Herostratus a "useful idiot in the service of the priesthood."[21]: 89 </p>
